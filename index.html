        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          I've spent the better part of the past decade working as a project
          manager, first for epxeriential marketing firms and then for web
          development agencies. Working with web designers and developers every
          day quickly made it clear that I'd rather be
          <em>doing</em> development work instead of managing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly after realizing it was time for a career change I resigned
          from my project management role and began self-teaching myself HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript before enrolling in Epicodus' C# & React bootcamp
          to deepen my knowledgebase and accelerate my learning.
        </p>
        <h3>Interests, Hobbies, and Skills</h3>
        <p>
          Part of my interest in development as a career comes from my lifelong
          interest in learning &#8212; something that the development industry
          provides infinite opportiunities for.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time you'll likely find me doing the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Working</strong> through programming tutorials</li>
          <li><strong>Tinkering</strong> with my own personal projects</li>
          <li><strong>Spending</strong> time with my wife and dog</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lifting</strong> weights (and setting them back down!)
          </li>
          <li><strong>Playing</strong> old video games for the 9000th time</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Secret skill: I can make an unnecessarily realistic eagle screech by
          whistling. I'm still looking for a way to make use of this skill and
          will update here when I find one some day...
